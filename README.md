# Oxford Notes
This is where I shall be putting my notes from oxford. You will not be able to view the maths in browser unless you get [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima?hl=en) chrome extension. It is written using [typora](http://typora.io). I would highly suggest it. The notes are not perfect by any means.
