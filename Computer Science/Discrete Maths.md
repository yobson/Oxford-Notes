# Discrete Maths

## Lecture 1

### What is discrete maths?

It is a study of mathematical structures that are discrete (not continuous). They include the following:

- Finite sets
- Sets of whole numbers
- Finite networks
- Strings with finite alphabets
- And so much more.

The things we study about discrete objects:

- Counting them
- Proving logical statements about them
- Designing and writing algorithms with them.
- Measuring 

Course Aims:

- Learn the terminology for the maths and computer science that uses it
- Practice techniques for computing with discrete structures
- Learn ways to prove mathematical statement.
