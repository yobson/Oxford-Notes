# General Philosophy

## Lecture 1- Historic Introduction, from Genesis to Descartes

### What is general philosophy?

- Some central issues of epistemology such as what can we know? as well as metaphysics such as what is the nature of things
- How philosophy is done
- A Historical focus - how it evolved

Examinations will have either or questions to encourage relatively deep study with the knowledge that it will be on the exam. Lectures convey key concepts so you need to read around.Topics are thematically connected so you can learn how that they contribute and influence world views.

You will need historic context for the exam if you want to do *very* well.

### Why bother with history of philosophy?

There are a few reasons:

- Philosophers set the agenda of what was studied. This is why science came from philosophy.
- You learn the labels and terms which are named after the people that discovered them. You often need to know about the history to learn about the terms.
- Also, historical philosophy is easier! Philosophy is built on older philosophy which means that it is bound to be more simple than now.
- Philosophical ideas often have deep and broad interconnections.
- When we look at the battles of ideas, context helps. For example, theists are not really going to be utilitarian.
- Many classic themes recur throughout the history of thought.
- Ignoring the past can make us slaves of the current and it can be harder to think outside that bubble. But things change and you need the tools to adapt to new ideas. There have been loads of changes in ideas in the history of philosophy.

Paradigms change and this is normally started in philosophy and always have repercussions in science to economics.

### Philosophy and Theology

Most philosophy has been connected to theology, this is because almost all societies had religion and it clamed to have an orthodoxy on knowledge. An example of how this influenced thinking was that God made the world for man. This leant to the natural way of thinking that there is purpose. This is called *teleology* and gives thing purpose. Why is there a sun? To keep us warm. 

Aristotle had a monopoly on philosophy for a while in the west and all of his philosophy was based n purpose. I came to this lecture to learn. P.Mill came to give the lecture. He said that things have purposive design (god designed things for a reason) and purposive action, things act as they to to archive some goal. Stones fall to reach the centre etc.

Aristotelian Science had Four elements: Fire air water and earth. Fire and air more up, water/earth down. Heavier things fall faster. He has Teleological  Physics. Things did as they did as they ultimately strived towards their goals.

But there was instability:

- Growth in population and trade.
- Discovery of the New World (America)
- Consequential economic disruption
- Realisation that ancient maps were wrong
- tech in weapons leading to centralisation of power
- Recovery of classical texts that were deemed heretical

This lead to the reformation. Rebelling from the church leading to much of Europe becoming protestant. English civil war and other wars lead to greater religious toleration.

This lead to another type of natural philosophy. It started from philosophy, as people saw more of the stars and planets, they started to try and fit what they saw to models. Galileo deduced that things must go round the sun instead of the earth. This blew apart Aristotelian physics and gave way for a new type of thinking and physics. He replaced Aristotelian physics with a more coherent theory based upon contradictions in it's theory of motions. The old theory couldn't explain the flight of a cannonball or why a sledge would travel uphill a little and then stop. He took out the teleological aspect of physics. No longer is the sledge striving to move, but instead, it is a passive agent, affected only by the forces that act upon it.

Why does water rise up  a siphon pipe? Because nature abhors a vacuum... this isn't an explanation because it is a teleological interpretation of the physics behind it. The new physics allows intelligibility and therefore the ability to predict things through maths. But there still is a problem. Why does the moon orbit around the earth? It cannot act under inertia because it moves around the sun, it should go in a straight line without a constant force?

Descartes bought about a new type of thinking which was scepticism. He attacked classical thinking by asking why we should believe them and built upon Galileo's mechanics. He was also a mathematician. Anything called Cartesian came from him. He was first to explain rainbows in detail, co-ordinate geometry, suggested circulation of the blood and also concluded that the earth orbited the sun. He wanted a fundamental basis for philosophy. He started from thinks that he could really know.

> I think therefore I am

> All I can know of myself initially is that I am a thinking thing

All that he said was based first upon this. The real qualities of of matter follow from it's essence.

Since matter's essence is extensions, non-material extension is impossible. Thus:

- The physical world is a plenum (no vacuum)
- All motion must take the form of circuits of motion within the plenum.
- This can give rise to vortices.
- This explains why the planets are in orbit.
